Fern
====

Fern (a German word meaning 'remote' or 'distant'; pronounced *f…õrn*) is a
remote execution framework written in [Hy](http://hylang.org/). Fern provides
tools for defining clusters of remote hosts, including metadata, and for
executing commands against those hosts, targeting them, arbitrarily, based on
their metadata.
